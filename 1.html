  <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>To be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer" target="_blank"title="Programmer의 Wikipedia">
    programmer</a> in the 1970s, ’80s, ’90s and most of the noughties was to be a nerd, a dweeb, a geek. Programmers registered high on
    screentime, and very, very low on social skills –<strong> or so the
      <u>public</u> thought.</strong></p>
      <img src="hahah.png" width="50%">
      <p style="margin-top:30px;">But in the last ten years, the general understanding of what it is to be a coder has shifted, helped in part by a new breed of programmer-turned-Silicon-Valley-star. Thanks to them, programmers now win plaudits as the creators of
  stunning digital products, as the creative talents behind global companies – real-life wizards who are changing the world in ways no one could have imagined.</p>
